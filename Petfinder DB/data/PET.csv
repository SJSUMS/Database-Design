She will not want to be up on the couch with you or to sleep on your bed—she prefers her pick of the beds in the living room. Snow will do best in a single-story home with a back yard. She needs a stay-at-home person that will care for her and give her the best rest of her life.

Nacho Man is a non-assuming but loyal friend. A fairly independent fellow, he doesn't ask for much: just a perch to look over his domain, a little playtime with you and a spot in your bed. He enjoys some petting but overall prefers to be in your company, adjacent to all that is. Nacho Man has a flea allergy which is managed with regular doses of his flea medicine. Meet Nacho Man if you want a cool cat who likes vertical spaces, snacks, and chilling out."
