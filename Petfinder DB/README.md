# Case Study: Petfinder Database Design
Petfinder is an online service where millions of pets find their families through adoption. The website provides a centralized space for animal shelters, rescue groups and adoption organizations to post about their available pets and relevant information to help pet lovers find their perfect match. It is a great resource for both providers and potential adopters to share information; however, pet information is sometimes duplicated, dated, or inconsistent because the organizations usually donâ€™t have a unified data structure and database system.

# Objective
This case study aims to help Petfinder establish an efficient database system to help people find pets based on locations and/or preferences and ensure availability, consistency, and accuracy of relevant pet and adoption details by building a centralized database management system for potential adopters and organizations including animal shelter, vet hospital and local rescue to manage and maintain their data.
